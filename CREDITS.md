This project was developed as part of the MLOps and Big Data course at Le Mans University. Despite all our efforts this project would not have been possible without the help and support of several individuals and resources.

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the following people and resources for their invaluable contributions:

- **Pr. Aghilas SINI** for his MLOps teaching and guidance throughout the project.
- **His [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AghilasSini/e2e-mlops)** which served as a foundational reference for our MLOps practices.
- **Pr. Nicolas DUGUÉ** for his Big Data expertise and support.
- **Le Mans University** for providing the necessary resources and environment to carry out this project.
